# c128_ghidra

This repo contains Ghidra support files for the analysis of Commodore 128 binaries.
It is based on the work by c64cryptoboy - c64cryptoboy/c64_ghidra (https://github.com/c64cryptoboy/c64_ghidra).

I am working on modifying it to support c128 instead of c64. Hopefully we can merge the two projects later.
